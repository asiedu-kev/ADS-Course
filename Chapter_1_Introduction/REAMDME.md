### Estimation Solutions 
1.21 - No, i've just got at most 300 pages per books and i have 
5 books currently so o'm near 1500 pages.
My school library stored at total 500k pages 

1.22 - There is 800 pages in this textbook and by looking at police 
of the text and so on, i can guess there is 100 words per page so
i can say there is 80k of words in this textbook.

1.23 - 
1 hour = 3600sec => 1000000 sec / 3600sec ~ 27h
1 day = 24h => 1000000 sec ~ 1,3day 

1.24 - There are 54 states in USA 
Let's say 20 cities and towns per state so 54 * 20 = 1080 

### Interview Problems
1.32 - 1.33 - See the file interview+problems.ts
1-35 - Previously we found 1080 cities in US and at
least we can have 10 gas stations per cities, so
1080 * 10 = 10800 gas stations
